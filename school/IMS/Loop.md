# Loop

1) Import dataset or allow a dataset to be instantiated

2) Automatically update the Stock amout 
Allow for maual changes (to account for theft)

3) If the stock is lower than a set percentage threshold make a banner and send a notification
Potentially allow an automatic system that will send an amount that needs purchasing to a supplier so that they can quickly get the order in

4) Save the database and encrypt it

5) Save the encrypted database on a server (I dont know if i actually have to do this or not)

If i have to actually store the data on a genuine server i will use either a rasberry (Which i have but its old) or my laptop (That is currently a minecraft server).

I can use excel while at school but while prototyping or experimenting at home without editing the actual project, i dont have access as im on linux (And not using excel on the web)
